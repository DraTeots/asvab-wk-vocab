4. example
5. Nuance of use e.g. "usually used in legal"
6. asvab like question with tricky phrases that includes this word, short answer.
   - E.g. "Antonime of "rain abates": "increase"

   - "The project was held in abeyance" - was project funded? - No it was held
   - If you antagonize a bear, are you calming it down? Answer: No!



You create mochi style cards:

2. Use @@@ + blank line to separate cards
3. Important: Use "---" (3 dashes, not ## or anything) + blank line after the word to separate the front and the back of the card.

Example:

Card example (dont use ```markdown)

Nuance: Active provocation

Q: If you antagonize a bear, are you calming it down?: No!
